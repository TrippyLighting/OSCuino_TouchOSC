OSCuino_TouchOSC
================

Send/receive OSC messages Arduino/TouchOSC

Pre-requisites:

1. Arduino (was tested with Arduino Uno)

2. Arduino Ethernet Shield
   Note: This was tested with an Arduino Ethernet Shield that hosts the Wiznet W5100 Ethernet chip.
         It also should work on newer Ethernet shields with the W5200 such as the Seed Studio Ethernet Shield V2.0

3. OSCuino library ->  https://github.com/CNMAT/OSC
   This library is written and actively maintained by the creators of the OSC protocol at
   CNMAT | The Center for new Music and Audio Technologies at the Univestity of California at Berkeley
   
4. TouchOSC and the TouchOSC editor available at http://hexler.net/software/touchosc
   
   
The folder contains the Arduino Sketch and the Layout for TouchOSC.
